// Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of
// another class. For example, a child inherits the traits of his/her parents.
// With inheritance, we can reuse the fields and methods of the existing class.
// The class which inherits the properties of other is known as subclass
// (derived class, child class) and the class whose properties are inherited is
// known as superclass (base class, parent class).
